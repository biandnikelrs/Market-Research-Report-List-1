<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gene Therapy in Oncology Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ex Vivo</li><li>In Vivo</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Gene therapy in oncology can be categorized into two main types: ex vivo and in vivo. Ex vivo gene therapy involves modifying a patient's cells outside the body and then reintroducing them to target cancer cells, offering a precise approach. In contrast, in vivo gene therapy delivers genetic material directly into the patient's body, aiming to alter cancer cell behavior or enhance immune response. Both strategies aim to improve treatment outcomes and reduce side effects in cancer patients.</p></p>
